# FractalLend

> P2P Lending Protocol for Ordinals and CAT-20 Tokens on Fractal Bitcoin

## Overview

FractalLend is a decentralized lending protocol that enables Bitcoin Ordinal holders to borrow CAT-20 tokens using their Ordinals as collateral. The platform facilitates peer-to-peer lending while ensuring security through smart contract-based liquidation mechanisms.

## Problem Statement

1. **Limited Liquidity**: Ordinal holders often face challenges in accessing liquidity without selling their NFTs
2. **Underutilized Assets**: Valuable Ordinal collections lack utility beyond collection and trading
3. **Market Inefficiency**: No standardized platform for P2P lending using Bitcoin NFTs as collateral
4. **Risk Management**: Need for secure collateralization and liquidation mechanisms

## Solution

FractalLend addresses these challenges by:

- Creating a secure P2P lending marketplace for Ordinal holders
- Enabling CAT-20 token holders to earn yield by lending
- Implementing automated liquidation mechanisms to protect lenders
- Providing real-time price feeds for accurate collateral valuation
